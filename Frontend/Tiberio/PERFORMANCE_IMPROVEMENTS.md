# Performance Improvements - API Call Overlapping Fix

## Problem Identified

The application was experiencing backend slowdowns, especially when navigating to the Inventory Management page quickly. This was caused by:

1. **Overlapping API calls** - Multiple requests being made simultaneously without cancellation
2. **Database connection pool exhaustion** - Each API call created a new database connection
3. **No request deduplication** - Multiple requests for the same data could be in flight simultaneously
4. **Missing connection cleanup** - Database connections weren't being properly released

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Request Cancellation with AbortController

**Files Modified:**
- `Frontend/Tiberio/src/services/category.js`
- `Frontend/Tiberio/src/services/supplier.js`
- `Frontend/Tiberio/src/screens/admin/InventoryManagement/InventoryManagement.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added AbortController support to all API calls
- Implemented request deduplication using a Map to track active requests
- Added proper cleanup when component unmounts
- Prevented error state updates for cancelled requests

### 2. API Utility Functions

**New Files:**
- `Frontend/Tiberio/src/services/apiUtils.js`
- `Frontend/Tiberio/src/hooks/useApi.js`

**Features:**
- Centralized API request management
- Request deduplication and cancellation
- Automatic auth token injection
- Consistent error handling
- Custom hooks for better API state management

### 3. Database Connection Pool Optimization

**Files Modified:**
- `Backend/config/db.js`
- `Backend/controller/categoryController.js`
- `Backend/controller/supplierController.js`

**Changes:**
- Configured connection pool limits and timeouts
- Added proper connection release in finally blocks
- Implemented connection reuse instead of creating new connections

## Key Improvements

### Frontend
- **Request Cancellation**: Prevents overlapping API calls when navigating quickly
- **Deduplication**: Only one request per endpoint can be active at a time
- **Proper Cleanup**: Requests are cancelled when components unmount
- **Error Handling**: Cancelled requests don't trigger error states

### Backend
- **Connection Pooling**: Limits concurrent database connections
- **Connection Reuse**: Properly releases connections after use
- **Timeout Configuration**: Prevents hanging connections
- **Queue Management**: Handles connection requests efficiently

## Usage Examples

### Using the Custom Hook
```javascript
import { useApi } from '../hooks/useApi';
import { getSuppliers } from '../services/supplier';

const { data: suppliers, loading, error, refetch } = useApi(
  'getSuppliers',
  getSuppliers,
  [] // dependencies
);
```

### Manual Request Management
```javascript
import { makeApiRequest, cancelRequest } from '../services/apiUtils';

// Make request with automatic deduplication
const data = await makeApiRequest('getSuppliers', getSuppliers);

// Cancel specific request
cancelRequest('getSuppliers');
```

## Performance Impact

- **Reduced Backend Load**: Eliminates overlapping requests
- **Faster Navigation**: Requests are cancelled when not needed
- **Better Resource Usage**: Database connections are properly managed
- **Improved User Experience**: No more backend slowdowns during rapid navigation

## Testing

To test the improvements:

1. Navigate quickly between pages, especially to Inventory Management
2. Check browser network tab - you should see cancelled requests
3. Monitor backend performance - should be more consistent
4. Verify no error states appear for cancelled requests

## Future Considerations

- Implement request caching for frequently accessed data
- Add request retry logic for failed requests
- Consider implementing optimistic updates for better UX
- Monitor connection pool usage in production
